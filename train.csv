considering first year program lot guest speakers various energy companies gave us lot practical knowledge energy industry case studies lectures etc basically learned finance concepts tools regular finance classes cases examples energy related professors good part great deal practical industry experience guess reason decreased participation program would probably say professors ronn titman great known technical quantitative students prefer less technical professors classes limiting energy industry also fact class meets 3 hours twice week may appealing things imagine drop enrollment especially understand every single person drop enron wonder something international status john massey mba class 1999 energy finance taken fall 1998 bottom line ut business schools great investment fund best activity available students energy finance program fairly weak watered version futures options class crossed weak finance appendage finance teacher pathetic poor teacher ignorant industry specific analysis devoid industry experience rude outside lectures industry keith brown educator good small portion class time way make better get teachers practical industry experience make seminar class focus case studies lectures given people industry promote class within business school felt like ut poor job internally students promoting class ross mesquita mba class 1999 energy finance taken fall 1998 honest great majority coursework energy specific energy applications presented seemed like general finance questions reworded include energy lingo good speakers part feel like 6 hours class enough energy focus assumed would get better program progressed one reason may account decline enrollment energy finance specific focus would probably enrolled energy finance program available first year know enough energy time returned b school consider several career options e investment banking corporate finance entrepreneurship marketing etc new mba student would want narrow window opportunities energy companies perspective probably something true many mbas interest enron brought energy industry vice versa billy braddock mba class 1999 energy finance taken fall 1998 participant

perspective basics energy business class structured via team based instruction approach 3 professors team teaching 6 hour credit course none 3 professors product knowledge energy business 3 professors 2 research focussed tenured little credibility teaching one professors primary focus research fixed income 2 investments corporate finance respectively case ut finance program general energy finance particular ut dire need teaching professors opposed research professors ability convey finance practical examples level easily understood students without finance background particular energy program

written widely application real options particularly fields life sciences technology e business special interest relationship risk assessment validation risk data financial valuation would sum approach business decision analytics projects set help businesses face massive uncertainties kind decision analysis helps people explore problems redesign decision making process increase chance making right choices example imagine biotechnology company decide whether put sale enter strategic relationship continue go alone options lead value enhancing value destroying scenarios work client firstly understand challenge assumptions associated likely business development scenarios secondly help identify decisions would help protect increase value technology company quantifying technical regulatory commercial risks sometimes challenge technology intensive fields however found managers often scientists quite willing describe main sources risk assess probability risky event may may occur kind risky decision making relate real options valuation say value asset decide might use means form opinion value asset must explore important decisions likely face significant impact value asset decision analysis helps define business problem uncover stream inter related choices effect real options example company trying decide whether invest risky project option pull plug investment early stage pilot project gives poor showing real option reduces riskiness increases potential value original business plan real options decision analysis really close one another believe real options valuations find decision analysis useful mean often decision analysis help managers identify key risks strategic decision attach weights show clearly interact many companies risk discovery valuable part exercise real options theory criticised recently well realistic practical approach valuation important hold unrealistic hopes real options approach valuation exciting methodology also sometimes reasonable way tackling practical problem example firm sells asset firm might make independent valuation asset legal corporate governance reasons many businesses today assets simply valued traditional ways difficult link cashflows cashflows might exist business novel might hidden respects real options analysis much closer reality traditional valuation exactly classic way valuing future business base calculation single discounted cashflow projected activity really take account way scenarios change fact managers react situations unfold mentioned earlier option kill project business early point upside pilot project yields exciting results might allow invest quickly reach revenue generating position much shorter time original business plan allows value future business really need look cashflows might arise number scenarios realistic project gets green light bet managers taking kind decision ground time challenging part mapping decision analysis tree modelling links variables decision tree something particular strengths also tricky know worthwhile add detail better draw back recent erisk interview rick buy chief risk officer enron said two years enron experimented real options concept found limited zero use slight air cynicism real options businesses today strange enron would profess attitude years ago widely reported used real option valuation support profitable purchase decision apparently bought cheaply older generators us generated electricity high cost knew could mothball year switch electricity prices sufficiently high nevertheless customer point view might much hype methodology one problem application real options technology perhaps many people trying tweak reality conform perfect model better aim something pragmatic clearly improves decisions time one pharmaceutical company worked recently worked together improve valuation analyses moving single discounted cash flow methodology one took account rather small set business scenarios would shocked academics consultants undeniable improvement original approach think financial institutions picking field applied energy industry 15 years might something relative stability banking world recently relatively high margins banking lines enjoyed also industries energy pharmaceuticals tend people engineering science background dynamic modelling decisions based methodologies originally dreamed help engineers design electrical electronic systems approach quite distinct black scholes options analyses banking world familiar black scholes approach difficult apply real options context everything depends assumptions put black scholes model real options approach hand sense way modelling assumptions explicitly banks adopting thinking particularly terms using decision analysis pinpoint risks identify value enhancing decisions using real options methodologies sort wheat chaff speculative investments mean internet investments recently worked major dutch bank arrived late internet game made considerable number investments even b 2 b business models questions marks hanging many b 2 c businesses already water wanted work investments might contain real value situation case ranking priorities helping bank make sense could turn decision making chaos rather sophisticated valuation case whether internet investment killed problem whether continued funding take priority budget demands major upgrades existing businesses practical questions answered somehow areas financial institutions seem accessible approach yes example think help work value associated various approaches

variables surrounding changed difficult compare original analysis things turn however value analysis comes final number value asset x also providing thorough process outsider point view understanding sources value short bit clearer thinking real options important rarely cited communications shareholders equity analysts battle still convince companies use real option valuations significant part internal analysis even major companies oil gas pharmaceutical sectors ideas taken root internally seems lot reluctance use external communication working analysts understand better need move things
